====================
 Technology Stack

This section outlines the technologies used in the Airbnb Clone backend and their specific roles in the project.

1- Django 
  Acts as the core backend framework responsible for handling business logic, routing requests, and defining models for users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews.

2- Django REST Framework (DRF)
  Used to build RESTful API endpoints that power the frontend of the Airbnb Clone. It manages all HTTP-based interactions like registering users, creating listings, or processing bookings.

3- PostgreSQL
  Stores all relational data such as user profiles, property details, bookings, payments, and reviews. Ensures data integrity and supports complex queries efficiently.

4- GraphQL
  Enables clients to request exactly the data they need (e.g., a property with only specific fields). It is especially useful for frontend performance and dynamic UIs by reducing over-fetching.

5- Celery 
  Handles background tasks like sending email confirmations, processing delayed payments, or notifying users of booking updates without blocking the main application flow.

6- Redis  
  Supports fast in-memory caching to store frequently accessed data like property details or session tokens. Also acts as a message broker for Celery to process asynchronous tasks.

7- Docker 
  Ensures that the development and production environments are consistent by containerizing the backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and other services used in the project.

8- CI/CD Pipelines
  Automatically tests and deploys code whenever changes are pushed to the repository, ensuring stable and continuous delivery of new features and bug fixes.
